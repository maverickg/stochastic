\chapter{Brownian motion}
\section{Scaling limit of random walks.}
Our first goal is to understand \emph{Brownian motion}, which is used to model ``noisy fluctuations'' of stocks, and various other objects.
This is named after the botanist Robert Brown, who observed that the microscopic movement of pollen grains appears random.
Intuitively, Brownian motion can be thought of as a process that performs a random walk in continuous time.

We begin by describing Brownian motion as the scaling limit of discrete random walks.
Let $X_1$, $X_2$, \dots, be a sequence of i.i.d.\ random variables which take on the values $\pm 1$ with probability $1/2$.
Define the time interpolated random walk $S(t)$ by setting $S(0) = 0$, and
\begin{gather}
  S(t) = S(n) + (t - n) X_{n+1}
  \quad\text{when } t \in (n, n+1]\,.
\end{gather}
Note $S(n) = \sum_{1}^n X_i$, and so at integer times $S$ is simply a symmetric random walk with step size $1$.

Our aim now is to rescale $S$ so that it takes a random step at shorter and shorter time intervals, and then take the limit.
In order to get a meaningful limit, we will have to compensate by also scaling the step size.
Let $\epsilon > 0$ and define
\begin{equation*}
  S_\epsilon(t) = \alpha_\epsilon S\paren[\Big]{ \frac{t}{\epsilon} }\,,
\end{equation*}
where $\alpha_\epsilon$ will be chosen below in a manner that ensures convergence of $S_\epsilon(t)$ as $\epsilon \to 0$.
Note that $S_\epsilon$ now takes a random step of size $\alpha_\epsilon$ after every $\epsilon$ time units.

To choose $\alpha_\epsilon$, we compute the variance of $S_\epsilon$.
Note first
\begin{equation*}
  \var S(t) = \floor{t} + (t - \floor{t})^2,
\end{equation*}
and consequently
\begin{equation*}
  \var S_\epsilon(t)
    = \alpha_\epsilon^2 \paren[\Big]{
	\floor[\Big]{\frac{t}{\epsilon}}
	+ \paren[\Big]{\frac{t}{\epsilon} - \floor[\Big]{\frac{t}{\epsilon}}}^2
    }\,.
\end{equation*}
In order to get a ``nice limit'' of $S_\epsilon$ as $\epsilon \to 0$, one would at least expect that $\var S_\epsilon(t)$ converges as $\epsilon \to 0$.
From the above, we see that choosing
\begin{equation*}
  \alpha_\epsilon = \sqrt{\epsilon}
\end{equation*}
immediately implies
\begin{equation*}
  \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \var S_\epsilon(t) = t\,.
\end{equation*}

\begin{theorem}
  The processes $S_\epsilon(t) \defeq \sqrt{\epsilon} S( t / \epsilon )$ ``converge'' as $\epsilon \to 0$.
  The limiting process, usually denoted by $W$, is called a (standard, one dimensional) \emph{Brownian motion}.
\end{theorem}

The proof of this theorem uses many tools from the modern theory of probability, and is beyond the scope of this course.
The important thing to take away from this is that Brownian motion can be well approximated by a random walk that takes steps of variance $\epsilon$ on a time interval of size $\epsilon$.
 

\section{A crash course in measure theoretic probability.}

Each of the random variables $X_i$ can be adequately described by finite probability spaces.
The collection of all $X_i$'s can not be, but is still ``intuitive enough'' to to be understood using the tools from discrete probability.
The limiting process $W$, however, can not be adequately described using tools from ``discrete'' probability: For each $t$, $W(t)$ is a continuous random variable, and the collection of all $W(t)$ for $t \geq 0$ is an \emph{uncountable} collection of \emph{correlated} random variables.
This process is best described and studied through measure theoretic probability, which is very briefly described in this section.

\begin{definition}
  The \emph{sample space} $\Omega$ is simply a non-empty set.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{$\sigma$-algebra} $\Sigma \subseteq \mathcal P(\Omega)$ is a \emph{non-empty} collection of \emph{subsets} of $\Omega$ which is:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item closed under compliments (i.e. if $A \in \Sigma$, then $A^c \in \Sigma$),
    \item and closed under \emph{countable} unions (i.e. $A_1$, $A_2$, \dots are all elements of $\Sigma$, then the union $\cup_1^\infty A_i$ is also an element of $\Sigma$).
  \end{enumerate}
  Elements of the $\sigma$-algebra are called \emph{events}, or $\Sigma$-measurable events.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
  The notion of $\sigma$-algebra is \emph{central} to probability, and represents \emph{information}.
  Elements of the $\sigma$-algebra are events whose probability are known.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  You should check that the above definition implies that $\emptyset, \Omega \in \Sigma$, and that $\Sigma$ is also closed under countable intersections and set differences.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{probability measure} on $(\Omega, \Sigma)$ is a \emph{countably additive} function $\P\colon \Sigma \to [0, 1]$ such that $\P(\Omega) = 1$.
  That is, for each $A \in \Sigma$, $\P(A) \in [0, 1]$ and $\P(\Omega) = 1$.
  Moreover, if $A_1,\ A_2, \dots \in \Sigma$ are \emph{pairwise disjoint}, then
  \begin{equation*}
    \P\paren[\Big]{ \bigcup_{i = 1}^\infty A_i } = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \P(A_i)\,.
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
For a $\Sigma$-measurable event $A$, $\P(A)$ is the probability of the event $A$ occurring.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  You should check that the above definition implies:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      $\P(\emptyset) = 0$,
    \item
      If $A, B \in \Sigma$ are disjoint, then $\P(A \cup B) = \P(A) + \P(B)$.
    \item
      $\P(A^c) = 1 - \P(A)$.
      More generally, if $A, B \in \Sigma$ with $A \subseteq B$, then $\P(B - A) = \P(B) - \P(A)$.
    \item
      If $A_1 \subseteq A_2 \subseteq A_3 \cdots$ and each $A_i \in \Sigma$ then $\P(\cup A_i) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \P(A_n)$.
    \item
      If $A_1 \supseteq A_2 \supseteq A_3 \cdots$ and each $A_i \in \Sigma$ then $\P(\cap A_i) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \P(A_n)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
  A \emph{random variable} is a function $X:\Omega \to \R$ such that for every $\alpha \in \R$, the set $\set{ \omega \in \Omega \st X(\omega) < \alpha }$ is an element of $\Sigma$.
  (Such functions are also called \emph{$\Sigma$-measurable}, \emph{measurable with respect to $\Sigma$}, or simply \emph{measurable} if the $\sigma$-algebra in question is clear from the context.)
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  The argument $\omega$ is \emph{always} suppressed when writing random variables.
  That is, the event $\set{\omega \in \Omega \st X(\omega) < \alpha}$ is simply written as $\set{X < \alpha}$.
\end{remark}
\begin{remark}
  Note for any random variable, $\set{X \geq \alpha} = \set{X < \alpha}^c$ which must also belong to $\Sigma$ since $\Sigma$ is closed under complements.
  You should check that for every $\alpha < \beta \in \R$ the events $\set{X \leq \alpha}$, $\set{X > \alpha}$, $\set{X \in (\alpha, \beta)}$, $\set{X \in [\alpha, \beta)}$, $\set{X \in (\alpha, \beta]}$ and $\set{X \in (\alpha, \beta)}$ are all also elements of $\Sigma$.

  Since $\P$ is defined on all of $\Sigma$, the quantity $\P( \set{X \in (\alpha, \beta)})$ is mathematically well defined, and represents the chance that the random variable $X$ takes values in the interval $(\alpha, \beta)$.
  For brevity, I will often omit the outermost curly braces and write $\P(X \in (\alpha, \beta))$ for $\P(\set{X \in (\alpha, \beta)})$.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  You should check that if $X$, $Y$ are random variables then so are $X \pm Y$, $XY$, $X/Y$ (when defined), $\abs{X}$, $X \varmin Y$ and $X \varmax Y$.
  In fact if $f: \R \to \R$ is any reasonably nice (more precisely, a Borel measurable) function, $f(X)$ is also a random variable.
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
  If $A \subseteq \Omega$, define $\one_A\colon \Omega \to \R$ by $\one_A(\omega) = 1$ if $\omega \in A$ and $0$ otherwise.
  Then $\one_A$ is a ($\Sigma$-measurable) random variable if and only if $A \in \Sigma$.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
  For $i \in \N$,  $a_i \in \R$ and $A_i \in \Sigma$ be such that $A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset$ for $i \neq j$, and define
  \begin{equation*}
    X\defeq \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i \one_{A_i}\,.
  \end{equation*}
  Then $X$ is a ($\Sigma$-measurable) random variable.
  (Such variables are called \emph{simple} random variables.)
\end{example}

Note above that $\P(X = a_i)$ is exactly $\P(A_i)$, and $\sum_i a_i \P(X = a_i) = \sum_i a_i \P(A_i)$ agrees with our notion of expectation from discrete probability.

\begin{definition}
  For the simple random variable $X$ defined above, we define \emph{expectation of $X$} by
  \begin{equation*}
    \E X = \sum_{i = 1}^\infty a_i \P(A_i)\,.
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}

For general random variables, we define the expectation by approximation.
\begin{definition}
  If $Y$ is a nonnegative random variable, define
  \begin{equation*}
    \E Y \defeq \lim_{n \to \infty} \E X_n
    \quad\text{where }
    X_n \defeq \sum_{k=0}^{n^2-1} \frac{k}{n} \one_{\set{\frac{k}{n} \leq Y < \frac{k+1}{n}}}\,.
  \end{equation*}
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  Note each $X_n$ above is simple, and we have previously defined the expectation of simple random variables.
\end{remark}
\begin{definition}
  If $Y$ is any (not necessarily nonnegative) random variable, set $Y^+ = Y \varmax 0$ and $Y^- = Y \varmin 0$, and define
  \begin{equation*}
    \E Y = \E Y^+ - \E Y^-\,,
  \end{equation*}
  provided at least one of the terms on the right is finite.
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}
  The expectation operator defined above is the \emph{Lebesgue integral} of $Y$ with respect to the probability measure $\P$, and is often written as
  \begin{equation*}
    \E Y = \int_\Omega Y \, d\P\,.
  \end{equation*}
\end{remark}

The expectation operator defined above satisfies the same properties you're familiar with for discrete random variables (e.g. $\E(X + \alpha Y) = \E X + \alpha \E Y$, but $\E XY \neq \E X \E Y$ etc.) but the proofs aren't easy!
It also behaves well with respect to taking limits (i.e. $\lim \E X_n = \E \lim X_n$, under modest assumptions) however, investigating these will lead us too far astray.
We invite the curious to look up \emph{the monotone/dominated convergence theorems} and their proofs.
The main point of this section was to introduce you to a framework which is capable of describing and studying the objects we will need for the remainder of the course.
